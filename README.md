## Getting Started
- In terminal, type `npm install`. If (and _only_ if) `npm install` isn't working, try `sudo npm install`. This should install all [dependencies](#dependencies).
- In terminal, enter `gulp`.
- Your browser should open at `http://localhost:3000`. You can access this same page on any device on the same wifi network and they'll see whats on your screen. It'll even sync scrolls and clicks!
